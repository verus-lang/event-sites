          <p class="text">Good engineers love well-written tests because they confirm that the code works correctly,
          at least for the tested inputs. What if you could check every possible input?</p>

          <p class="text">In software verification, tests are replaced by a complete specification; the verifier provides
          a compile-time check that the implementation matches the specification,
          providing a much stronger guarantee than traditional testing.
          Instead of writing tests, the developer's effort towards correctness is focused on explaining
          why the implementation is correct, in the form of proof annotations.
          <span class="highlight">These techniques can help Systems Researchers build reliable, secure systems, with less
            reliance on runtime checking, which can be expensive.</span></p>

          <p>This tutorial introduces <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus"><span class="highlight-0">Verus</span></a><span class="highlight-2">, an open-source,
          Rust-based verification tool designed specifically for systems software.
          Verus provides efficient proof automation and scales to large, complex systems.</span>
          Verus is developed by a community of academic and industry contributors,
          it is already seeing industrial use at Microsoft and Amazon,
          and two of three best papers at OSDI 2024 are built on Verus.</p>

          <p class="text">
          <span class="highlight-0">Verus is open source at <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus</a>.</span>
          </p>

          <p>This tutorial will briefly introduce the state-of-the art in software verification,
          covering the benefits and challenges of verification as an engineering methodology,
          especially with regards to systems software.
          It will then introduce Verus's basic features with a set of interactive exercises.
          No prior knowledge of Rust is required beyond familiarity with C-like languages.
          The tutorial will then move on to verification principles, and Verus techniques necessary
          to verify complex systems involving
          <span class="higlight">non-trivial data structures, network communication, and shared-memory concurrency</span>.

            <span class="highlight-2">Prerequisites.</span>
            The tutorial will introduce Verus from the ground up, assuming familiarity with systems programming.
            Prior knowledge of Rust is not necessary.
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            <span class="highlight-2">Morning.</span>
            The first part of the tutorial will be geared towards systems programmers and researchers with little
            to no background in verification: we will start from simple Rust programs that the attendees will
            verify with the help of the organizers, and we will progressively move to more complex examples that
            introduce the core concepts necessary to get started in systems verification with Verus.
          </p>

          <p><span class="highlight">The morning program is designed to be self-contained. In the afternoon,
            attendees can choose to switch to a different workshop, or continue working on the material and
            exercises presented in the morning with the help of the organizers.</span></p>

          <p class="highlight-0">Morning Program (tentative):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Overview of uses of verification, and introduction to systems verification;</li>
              <li>Verus set up: how to run it and where to find documentation;</li>
              <li>Verifying simple functions with pre- and post-conditions (with hands-on exercise);</li>
              <li>Verifying programs with loops using loop invariants (with hands-on exercise);</li>
              <li>Primers on "quantifiers" (∀/∃), how they are used in specifications and proofs (with hands-on exercise);</li>
              <li>Primer on SMT solvers (underlying Verus's automation);</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            <span class="highlight-2">Afternoon.</span>
            In the second half of the day, we will continue by building up to more complex systems, protocols,
            and verification tasks. This will be done in a way that allows attendees already familiar with verification
            to get exposure to the more advanced Verus features, such as support for verifying the correctness of
            programs with shared-memory concurrency, while letting attendees continue to build up their
            verification skills on a harder set of exercises.

          <p class="highlight-0">Afternoon Program (tentative):</p>
            <ul>

                Engineering and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  Bryan's
                research is primarily focused on investigating long-term, fundamental
                improvements in how to design and build secure systems.  His dissertation won
                the 2010 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award, and in 2011 he was selected for Forbes'
                30-Under-30 Science List. He formalized and worked to optimize verifiable
                computation, receiving a Best Paper Award (and later a Test-of-Time Award) at
                the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy for his advances. He coauthored a
                book on Bootstrapping Trust in Modern Computers, and his work in that area has
                been incorporated into the latest security enhancements in Intel CPUs. His
                research into security for new application models was incorporated into Windows
                and iOS and received Best Paper Awards at the IEEE Symposium on Security and
                Privacy and the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and
                Implementation. He then extended his interest in bootstrapping trust to the
                problem of building practical, formally verified secure systems, for which he
                received three Distinguished Paper Awards.  He is also the recipient of the
                Joel and Ruth Spira Excellence in Teaching Award.

                  Travis Hance is a recent PhD graduate from Carnegie Mellon University advised by Bryan Parno,
                  and he will soon start as a postdoctoral researcher
                  at the Max Plank Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS).
                  He researches formal methods applied to low-level systems software,
                  and he has verified a number of production-grade low-level systems, including:
                  VeriBetrKV, a crash-safe key-value store;
                  a high-performance page cache; a high-performance state replication algorithm; and a memory allocator.
                  He has a particular interest in Rust, due to its unique combination of features that make it
                  particularly well-suited for the verification of systems software, and he is a co-developer of Verus,
                  focusing especially on its support for verified multi-threaded software and low-level libraries.
                  Before Verus, he developed the IronSync framework in Linear Dafny.
                  He also works with concurrent separation logic, and he has developed the ``Leaf'' library,
                  a framework for modular specifications of data structures that involve shared, read-only state.
