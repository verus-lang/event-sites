The three exercises in this directory illustrate the 3 main concepts from the 'Advanced Rust Topics' lecture.

 1. `exercise_01_memoize.rs` - Illustrates interior mutability and encapsulated mutation.
 2. `exercise_02_doubly_linked_list.rs` - Illustrates unsafe pointer code using `PointsTo` permissions.
 3. `exercise_03_counting_to_2.rs` - Illustrates VerusSync through in simple concurrent program.

These are ordered roughly in order of difficulty.
Exercises 1 and 2 are independent of each other and can be done
in either order, but I would recommend doing both before doing 3.
